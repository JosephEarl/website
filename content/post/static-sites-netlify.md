This site is hosted with [Netlify](http://netlify.com). Why?

If you've ever used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site you'll know how easy it is to setup and deploy your site.

Netlify does the same job, but also supports a bunch more static site generators (like [Hexo](https://hexo.io) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) -- which this site uses) as well as free HTTPS with custom domain names using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). 
Enabling HTTPS is as simple as clicking a button and Netlify manages renewing your SSL certificates for you.

They also provide a global CDN to ensure your content gets to your users as quickly as possible.
