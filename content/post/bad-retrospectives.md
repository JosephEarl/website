A number of times I've seen teams get stuck in a rut with their retrospectives. They run them, but more for the sake of following Scrum or some other agile process. 

Team members pay little attention, playing on phones or laptops, the person running the retrospective steps through the same plan -- little distinguishes this retrospective from the last, and the one before that.

Critical metrics are either absent, overburdening or perhaps worst of all -- the burndown chart is the only metric used, and the sole metric the team is evaluated on. Burndown charts provide enough information to the team to understand they have a problem, but not enough insight to determine what the problem is.

Such retrospectives deliver little to no value to the team and are ultimately a black hole. Prior to the event horizon a team may use the retrospective itself to reform or end this currently useless process. 

Past the event horizon there is little hope -- the team is doomed to repeat this usless process, unquestioning: it has internalized running a process for the sake of it. 

In such situations often the only way to break the cycle can be the introduction of external stimuli -- new team members with fresh ideas, agile coaches, a change of manager, etc.

There is one thing that all teams exhibiting this behaviour have in common: little to no effort is expended on preparation and running of the retrospective to make it engaging and keep it fresh.

This may because the team sees no value in it or a sign of the team being overworked -- the team sees any time spent on the retrospective (and other ceremonies and meetings) as taking away from more important work that they should be performing. This priority is often reinforced by managers and organisational goals.
